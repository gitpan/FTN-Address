DESCRIPTION
    FTN::Address

METHODS
  new

    3D, ex.: new FTN::Address '2:464/0' 4D, ex.: new FTN::Address
    '2:464/4077.1' 5D, ex.: new FTN::Address '2:464/357.0@fidonet'

    Default domain for 3D and 4D address is 'fidonet'

  empty
    This method creates empty FTN::Address object. You cannot use it before
    assigning a new value.

    Takes no parameters.

  assign( $address )
    This method assign new address to FTN::Address object.

    Takes FTN address as argument (like 'new' method).

  get()

    Takes no parameters.

  getfull()
    This method returns qualified 5D address.

    Takes no parameters.

  fqdn( [ $root_domain [, $level ] ] );
    This method returns fully qualified domain name, as described in

     my $addr = new FTN::Address('2:464/4077');
 
     print $addr->fqdn();                    # f4077.n464.z2.fidonet.net
 
     print $addr->fqdn('org');               # f4077.n464.z2.fidonet.org
